Logistic Regression from Scratch
================================================================================

ðŸ“˜ Description:
----------------
This script implements Logistic Regression from scratch using only NumPy.
It is designed to provide a foundational understanding of how binary 
classification and gradient descent work under the hood.

ðŸ“‚ Files:
----------
- Logistic_From_Scracth.ipynb : Jupyter notebook containing the full implementation.
- logisticX.csv               : Input features for the dataset.
- logisticY.csv               : Target labels for binary classification.

ðŸ“Œ Features:
-------------
- Binary classification using logistic regression
- Manual implementation of sigmoid activation
- Vectorized gradient descent
- Cost function computation
- Plotting the decision boundary (if Matplotlib is used)
- Accuracy evaluation

ðŸ”§ Requirements:
-----------------
- Python 3.x
- numpy
- matplotlib (optional for plotting)

Install dependencies:

    pip install numpy matplotlib

ðŸš€ How to Run:
---------------
1. Run the notebook `Logistic_From_Scracth.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook.
2. Make sure `logisticX.csv` and `logisticY.csv` are in the same directory.
3. Run all cells to train the model and see results.

ðŸ“š Learning Objectives:
------------------------
- Understand how logistic regression works internally.
- Learn to implement gradient descent manually.
- Practice using NumPy for efficient matrix operations.
